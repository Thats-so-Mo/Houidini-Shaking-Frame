Inspired by the chilling tales and the enigmatic legacy of Houdini, I created the Houdini Shaking Frame for a Halloween event. This prop follows the eerie theme of my previous Ghost Box trick and aims to create a visually captivating illusion of ghostly interference.

The concept revolves around the frame shaking as if influenced by an unseen force, mimicking the type of activity often depicted in paranormal investigations. To achieve this, I used a combination of technology, creative engineering, and some nostalgic gaming components.

The Wemos D1 Mini serves as the brain of the operation, creating a web server that acts as the control hub. By connecting to the device and navigating to the IP address 192.168.4.1, users can access a custom-built webpage featuring controls to trigger the shaking effect. This webpage allows for precise control over the prop, enhancing the realism of the ghostly interference.

At the heart of the shaking effect are vibrating motors repurposed from a PlayStation 2 controller. These motors create the desired shaking effect, simulating the randomness of paranormal activity. However, for a more intense effect, more powerful or stronger motors may be required.

One of the most exciting aspects of this prop is the wireless control. Using their smartphones, users can trigger the shaking effect at will, making it appear as though the frame is reacting to the environment or commands from beyond. This seamless integration of technology and illusion adds an extra layer of mystery and excitement to any Halloween setup.

The Houdini Shaking Frame is not just a prop; it's an experience. It brings together the thrill of ghost hunting shows and the legacy of Houdini's escape acts, all wrapped in a package that's sure to mesmerize and spook any audience.

Note: This trick requires two people to pull off. You need an inside man, a plant, a partner to make it work!
